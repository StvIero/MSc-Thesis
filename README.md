In this paper, the aim is to produce accurate stock predictions. Recurrent Neural Networks
have made considerable advances in this field but results vary across dataset and
applications. A Recurrent Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is compared
to a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The
predictions generated are fed back into the training sets and new predictions are made
giving them a more ’dynamic’ element. Results suggest that for scarcity of data such an
approach increases the predictive power of those model. Both ’dynamic’ versions outperform
the Recurrent ARIMA model especially for low amount of available data and short
term predictions. NASDAQ 100 index was investigated with data collected ranging from
1 to 5 years. Predictions were made for 5 (week), 21 (month) and 63 (quarter) trading
days.
